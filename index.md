          <h2>A brief history of me</h2>
            <p> I am a life-long resident of Minnesota. I live in a suburb of the Twin Cities, in a town called Roseville. I am currently a very confused graduate student at the University of Minnesota in the Technical Communication Graduate Certificate program. </p>
            <p> My hope is that sometime soon this whole coding process will make sense to me. I would like to have more to share with the world than the names of all my cats! </p>
